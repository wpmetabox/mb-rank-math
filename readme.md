> **Meta Box Lite**<br>
> We recommend using [Meta Box Lite](https://metabox.io/lite/), a feature-rich free UI version of Meta Box that provides UI and all free features for managing custom fields and dynamic content on WordPress, including post types, taxonomies, custom fields, and relationships.

There are situations when we create custom fields to store real content for the posts. They are actually displayed in the frontend. Search engines such as Google or Bing see them and analyze them. But by default, Rank Math plugin takes only post content to analyze for SEO score and gives us feedback based on the post content. The plugin doesn't analyze the all the content that appears to the search engine, which is a big missing part and that sometimes confuses us in SEO term.

So, the plugin *MB Rank Math Integration* fixes that problem by allowing us to add custom fields to the content analyzed by Rank Math plugin. This way, the Rank Math plugin and search engine will see the same content and we will have a correct advice for SEO content as well as correct SEO score.
